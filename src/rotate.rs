//! What this process does when the certificate it is serving is replaced
//! underneath it.
//!
//! **Serving certificates are read ONCE, when the listener is built.**
//! [`crate::serve::builder`] hands tonic an acceptor holding an
//! `Arc<ServerConfig>` built there and then, and nothing afterwards can swap it:
//! `tonic 0.14`'s TLS settings are documented as ignored under
//! `serve_with_incoming`, which is the only custom-acceptor path there is. So a
//! pod started today serves its day-0 leaf until it restarts, whatever cert-manager
//! writes into the Secret in the meantime.
//!
//! The chart mounts those Secrets as DIRECTORIES rather than with `subPath`,
//! deliberately, so kubelet does refresh the files inside the pod. Only the
//! process never re-reads them.
//!
//! # The ruling: exit on change
//!
//! This module polls a digest of every TLS input the process read at boot — one
//! per file, so a change can be reported by NAME. The set is the serving
//! certificate, the private key belonging to it, the CA bundle `task-db` is
//! verified against, and the client certificate and key this service presents to
//! `task-db` (ADR-0516). On a change it logs which file, and the old and new leaf
//! fingerprint, waits out a per-pod splay, and ends — and the caller selects on
//! that, drains, and returns `Ok(())`. Kubelet restarts the container and the new
//! process reads the fresh file. **A change is not an error, so the exit code is
//! 0.**
//!
//! **THE CLIENT CERTIFICATE IS THE MEMBER WITH THE WORST FAILURE.** ADR-0516
//! records that an expired CLIENT leaf STOPS a hop rather than degrading it, so a
//! process that read it once and never again keeps serving perfectly and stops
//! being able to reach its own store — on a date, with nothing having warned. The
//! serving leaf is the milder case this module was originally written for.
//!
//! # THIS IS A COPY, and saying so is the point
//!
//! **`iam/src/rotate.rs` is the original and this is the second copy; `gateway`
//! carries a third.** ADR-0523 says to lift the core into shared code before the
//! third, and this car defers that DELIBERATELY rather than by omission: shared
//! crates here are separate repositories consumed by git tag, so a lift needs a
//! fourth repository merged and tagged before any of these three changes could
//! compile, and this car has authority to do neither.
//!
//! **The core below is byte-identical to `iam`'s** — `Schedule`, `Watched`,
//! `Leaf`, `Presented`, `watch`, `watch_with_seed`, `splay`, `seed`, `never`,
//! `digest_of`, `hex`, and every method on `Inputs` except the builders. What
//! differs is enumerated rather than left to be discovered:
//!
//! 1. `SERVICE` is a module constant here; `iam` reads `crate::service::SERVICE`.
//! 2. `listener` takes `crate::serve::ServeTls`; `iam`'s takes `ServerTls`.
//! 3. There is no `enrolment` builder — that CA is `iam`'s alone (D73).
//! 4. This service's watch set is EMPTY when TLS is off, where `iam`'s is not.
//!
//! A copy held together only by a paragraph is a copy that drifts. Keep this list
//! true, and lift the whole thing when the lift car runs.
//!
//! In-process hot reload was rejected and is not available anyway, for the
//! reason above. A reloader operator was rejected because it fails silent until
//! the deadline and leaves off-reference adopters broken (D80).
//!
//! # THE PROPERTY THAT DECIDED IT, and the one every change here must keep
//!
//! **If the watcher dies you get today's behaviour, never worse.** A file that
//! cannot be read is not a changed one; an unparsable certificate is not a
//! changed one; no TLS at all means no watch. Nothing here may end the watch
//! over a state it is merely unsure about, because ending it exits the process.
//!
//! # A hash, never a modification time
//!
//! Kubelet rotates a mounted Secret by writing a whole new timestamped directory
//! and `rename`ing a replacement `..data` symlink over the old one. Every path
//! the process holds then resolves to a DIFFERENT inode with a fresh
//! modification time — on every resync, whether or not a single byte changed. An
//! mtime check restarts both replicas for nothing; a content hash does not.
//! `tests/tls_rotation.rs` performs that exact swap rather than overwriting a
//! file in place.
//!
//! # The splay, and why a PDB is not a substitute
//!
//! Both replicas see the refreshed file inside the same kubelet sync window, so
//! an unsplayed exit can drop both at once. **A PodDisruptionBudget does not
//! govern a self-exit** — it constrains eviction, and nothing is evicting
//! anything here. The splay is the only control. Renewal lands 30 days before
//! expiry, so the slack is enormous and minutes of waiting cost nothing.
//!
//! # The gauge is the half that makes a failure loud
//!
//! [`Inputs::export_not_after`] publishes the expiry of every certificate this
//! process ACTUALLY LOADED (D67), one series per certificate, told apart by a
//! `kind` label carrying `serving` or `client`. If the watcher dies, that gauge
//! still shows the loaded leaf ageing out — which is what a watcher whose own
//! failure is silent would not give anybody.
//!
//! # "TLS is off" DOES mean "nothing is watched", here
//!
//! Unlike `iam`, this service reads no security material outside its transport,
//! so a cleartext deployment has an empty watch set and this module idles. The
//! schedule is still parsed at boot in that case: a value an operator set and the
//! binary cannot use is an error whether or not the watcher would have run.
