//! Client-side load balancing over a headless Service (D23).
//!
//! **The problem this solves is not obvious and is easy to declare solved.** gRPC
//! runs on HTTP/2 and holds ONE long-lived connection. A normal Kubernetes
//! Service balances at L4 — at connection time — so a client opens one connection,
//! gets one pod, and sends every request there for the life of the process. The
//! other replicas sit idle while looking healthy, and D68's autoscaler responds
//! to the resulting latency by adding more pods that also receive nothing.
//!
//! So the Service is HEADLESS: DNS returns every pod address rather than one
//! virtual IP, and the client balances across them itself.
//!
//! **Re-resolution is the part that must not be forgotten.** Resolving once at
//! startup pins the client to whichever pods existed then — new replicas get no
//! traffic, and a rolling update leaves the client talking to addresses that no
//! longer exist. That is the failure D68 calls self-amplifying, and it is a
//! property of D23 rather than of the autoscaler.
//!
//! NOTE ON THE EMPTY CASE: the refresh loop never acts on an empty resolution.
//! A headless Service briefly returns nothing during some rollouts, and removing
//! every endpoint on that basis is a self-inflicted outage from a transient DNS
//! answer. `diff` itself has no such opinion — it is pure — so the guard lives in
//! the loop and the test for the recovering-from-zero case lives here.
