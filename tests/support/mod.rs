//! Running the REAL `yadgar-task` binary the way a pod runs it: with
//! `/etc/yadgar/config/shared/shared.yaml` mounted, as the only file it reads
//! from a fixed path (ledger 748).
//!
//! **WHY A MOUNT NAMESPACE.** `yadgar_lifecycle::rotate::Configuration::mounted`
//! reads `/etc/yadgar/config/shared/shared.yaml` unconditionally and has no
//! environment override, by design: the path is the chart's `mountPath`. A test
//! cannot write under the host's `/etc`, so every run goes through
//! `unshare -rm`, which gives the binary a private mount table in which `/etc`
//! is an overlay over the real one. The document's DIRECTORY is a bind mount of
//! a per-test host directory, which is the shape kubelet gives a ConfigMap
//! volume — and it is what lets a test rewrite the file from outside the
//! namespace. Writing into an overlay's upperdir while it is mounted is
//! undefined behaviour; renaming inside a bind-mounted directory is not.
//!
//! `exec` at the end of the script replaces `sh`, and `unshare` without
//! `--fork` replaces itself, so the pid `Command` returns IS the binary's pid:
//! a SIGTERM sent to it reaches the process under test and nothing in between.
//!
//! **NO PROBE, NO SKIP.** If the runner forbids unprivileged user namespaces,
//! `mount` fails, the script exits non-zero before the binary starts, and every
//! wait below reports that with the captured stderr. `no-test-skips` forbids
//! probe-and-skip, and a harness that passed without running would certify
//! nothing.
//!
//! **EVERY WAIT FAILS ON ITS DEADLINE.** There is no wait here that returns
//! `None`: on its deadline it kills the child and panics, naming the wait and
//! printing every line the binary wrote.

// Each test target compiles its own copy of this module and uses a subset of it.
