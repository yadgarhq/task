//! The drain budget, and the defect it was introduced as.
//!
//! **THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP DEAD.** The first attempt at bounding the
//! drain wrapped the SERVING FUTURE in `tokio::time::timeout`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! tokio::time::timeout(DRAIN_BUDGET, server.serve_with_shutdown(addr, stop)).await
//! ```
//!
//! `timeout` fixes its deadline when it is CALLED, and the serving future spans
//! the server's whole life — so that bounds the SERVER, not its drain. The
//! process logged "the drain did not finish within its budget" and exited 25
//! seconds after boot, on every boot, TLS on or off, with no rotation and no
//! signal, and kubelet restarted it to do it again — in exchange for a watcher
//! whose default poll interval of 60s meant it never completed one pass.
//!
//! It passed 123 tests in `iam`, because every one of them tested a piece and
//! none tested the composition. This file is a copy of `iam/tests/drain.rs`,
//! taken with the drain budget it covers: a copy of the code without a copy of
//! its regression test would leave the same defect available here and unwatched.
//! So the assertion below is about ELAPSED TIME rather than outcome: a server asked to stop at 600ms under a 100ms budget must still be
//! serving at 350ms, and the call must return at 600ms and not at 100ms. The
//! broken shape fails both.
//!
//! `serve::drain_within` exists to make that shape unavailable: it takes the
//! server ALREADY SPAWNED and the sender that asks it to stop, so the budget
//! cannot be started before the request that it bounds.
