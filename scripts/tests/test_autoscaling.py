"""THE SCALED OBJECT THIS CHART RENDERS, and what keeps its group one with the check.

THE COUNTERPART OF `test_render_checks.py`, AND THE SPLIT IS THE REFERENCE'S. In
`yadgarhq/iam-db` the render-check harness is one file and the gates that read the
chart's own rendered objects are another (`test_mariadb.py`); this file is that
second half, copied from it (ADR-0679) with the MariaDB CR replaced by the
ScaledObject and the engine-contract gates — which have no counterpart here —
dropped rather than reimagined.

WHAT IT CARRIES THAT `test_render_checks.py` CANNOT. Two things, and both are about
this chart rather than about the construction:

  - THE DEFAULT RENDER'S OBJECT COUNT, against a literal. The render-check harness
    asserts only that the defaults render no object of a CHECKED group — the half
    that belongs to the check. The other half, that the default render is otherwise
    UNCHANGED by this whole change, is a count, and it lives here.
  - THE ONE SOURCE FOR THE GROUP-AND-VERSION STRING. The string is a literal in
    `templates/render-checks.yaml`, because the harness reads the invocation's
    arguments off the template, and it is recorded a second time in `values.yaml`
    beside the toggle. Two files hold it and this is the gate that keeps them one.

EVERY NUMBER HERE IS A LITERAL. A number derived from the thing under test agrees
with whatever that thing happens to be and detects nothing.
